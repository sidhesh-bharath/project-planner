Project planer allows you to plan your projects efficiently. It uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to generate a comprehensive plan on the idea inputted by the user.

To use the program, make a .env file in the same directory as the main.py file with the contents:
```API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"```
